**target level: 3**

- Fire Res
- Flat Damage
- Any Amulet
- [ROGUE] Throwing Damage
- [ROGUE] Bow
## The Fortress Gardens
![[Pasted image 20250409012544.png]]
[ROGUE] you should be clearing these in groups using Shurikens
[ROGUE] Skill: Acid Flask -> Caustic Concoction (this will be your main skill until Puncture)
[ROGUE] Passive: Swift Assassin (your first 8 levels go there for the flat damage)
&nbsp
**target level: 4**

## The Fortress Walls
- Skip All the enemies until Sturiax
- Focus on dodging Sturiax's attacks and use AoEs to clear the mobs that followed you there while you damage him
- At the waypoint go left, and exit to the Storeroom

## The Storerooms
![[Pasted image 20250409014048.png]]
- Kill the miniboss (Forged Soldier) 
- click the Siege Golem
- Exit back to Fortress Walls
## The Fortress Walls
![[Pasted image 20250409014226.png]]
Top Option twice = Passive Point
Ignore Other NPC and exit north
## The Keepers's Vault
![[Pasted image 20250409014441.png]]
Shrines in this Area can be a big boost
- Kill the Forged Soldier and proceed north
[ROGUE] While door opens, swap Acid Flask to Puncture and a bow
&nbsp
![[Pasted image 20250409015327.png]]
&nbsp
as soon as you click "They're coming!" you can exit top left without doing the fight

![[Pasted image 20250409015604.png]]
Throughout the zone keep an eye out for those shrines, they might clear packs for you.

## The Northern Road
![[Pasted image 20250409015809.png]]
- You need to walk with the NPC up to that point, if you go too fast it may get stuck at the start.
- As soon as you click the NPC you could warp to town immediately by pressing T, without any further dialogues 
- [OPTIONAL] you can go left first for a chest if you need a gear upgrade
![[Pasted image 20250409015927.png]]
## The Keepers' Camp
![[Pasted image 20250409020120.png]]
This time you need to talk to her, get your passive point.
Exit East
## Ulatri Highlands
![[Pasted image 20250409020328.png]]
Straight Line to the exit. use shrines on the way / clear big packs with your AoEs if it doesn't slow you down
You can go over the edges with movement skills on most of this map
## The Osprix Warcamp
![[Pasted image 20250409020608.png]]
Again, go straight to the exit only clearing large packs with AoEs if it doesn't slow you down, or using shrines.
## The Summit

[ROGUE] You should have your 2nd Skill soon, Specialize into Shift then: Velocity 2 -> Momentum 2

![[Pasted image 20250409021300.png]]
Once you reach this spot you have some time before the boss can be damaged, equip your highest damage weapon, often it's a 2H w/ Status or a 1H melee with high flat that you craft on the way to the boss arena, level your passives, etc.

For the boss fight
- During the transformation you can keep dps-ing, it does not hurt
- first move after the transformation is flying away from you, keep your mobility skill to follow
- There's many tricks to glitch the AI into attack patterns that can't hit you but overall this fight is very safe to do in melee range dodging behind the boss while he attacks

After the fight
- Press T, immediately Warp back you don't need to talk to that NPC
## The Keepers' Camp
![[Pasted image 20250409021807.png]]
- Talk to Lady
- Talk to Balthas
- You have some time waiting where you can put passives / look at gear before you get Warped to A2

Take the shard, then go through the north-east path.

![[Pasted image 20250409022024.png]]
that speech bubble there is the location of the one dangerous enemy in that zone, ignore the NPC there and skip the enemy but if you want, keep its aggro as you keep aoe-ing behind you and you'll reach soldiers at the end of the zone that can tank and kill it for you which is likely to give you good loot to jumpstart your A2 clear.
![[Pasted image 20250409022242.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250409022253.png]]
## Last Refuge Outskrits

- Ignore Bravon (Main Quest) at the start of the zone, it autocompletes as you cross the bridge
- Take the sidequest, Clear it by going South East then North West then to the last one through North East and the small path going back to the last NPC. This is the 2nd and only other sidequest we'll do until A5. This will give us a Passive point when we reach town
![[Pasted image 20250409022855.png]]
Enemies in the zone are not really worth fighting in general, kill them while waiting for bridges and mostly skip straight to the miniboss at Ezra, fight with his help and leave to the Council Chambers
